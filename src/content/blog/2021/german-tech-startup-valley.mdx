Here I was finally in Cologne, Germany on a Sunday evening. I had just flown from Portugal on the morning of that same day. To my left is the Hohenzollern Bridge, a railway and pedestrian bridge. Quite beautiful, and hard to believe it was destroyed nearly 80 years ago by the German military during Cologne's invasion by the Allied troops.

I had come in business, so unfortunately not so much sightseeing for me, at least on the more cultural side. But my goals here were other anyways.

Joining a Tech Startup in Germany was something that has been wandering on my mind for quite some time now. Framing it quite raw, I'm a boy grown in Lisbon, Portugal a southern European country on the Iberian Peninsula. And thus, my most appealing international career choices mainly rely on the US, UK, or Germany.

Having worked at least once in all of these countries, my experience is that the US is a good employer, but depending on the maturity of their teams, timezone synchronicity may pose a real challenge. Plus the commute to visit the office and your coworkers, is quite hard, given the flight duration and cost.

Then we have the UK — constant odd gray weather, the inverted road traffic system, IR35 for contracting (United Kingdom's anti-avoidance tax law), and BREXIT which in overall make it less desirable when we pose our eyes in Germany!

Timezone difference of just 1 hour and look at the numbers:

- Right after the UK on number of startups to the date
- 46 unicorn startups to the date with 74 more to come
- An overall VC funding of 44.2 billion euros, with exits over 100 billion on an ecosystem valued at 433 billion

The UK may look better, but Germany is doing just fine as well.

## epilot: A Diamond Gem Under a Rock

And so, fortunately, by May 10th I joined a really cool startup called epilot. If I could describe what epilot is for me in a sentence, I would say:

> "A diamond gem under a rock!"

From product-centric companies to consultancy, I've quite a few years on me doing consultancy both through intermediary companies or directly, and that has been by choice. When the demand for your services is high, suddenly having a permanent contract with a company stops being something you actively and eagerly seek. It may still be appealing, but it's just way lower on the priority list.

So, when I say that epilot is a diamond gem under a rock, I know what I'm talking about.

### Why a Diamond Gem?

Well, epilot is 4 years old and has done nothing but to grow, and not just grow for the sake of increasing headcount. So far it has grown in a very structured way to accommodate their's and their customer's needs at the right time with the right people. So growth and on track give epilot the gem status.

Why diamond? Because after having built what they are doing as a product for US and UK companies at least twice, and after seeing its complexity and value, I have oversight that their product has not only National potential on the energy sector but rather International as well on different markets.

From a potential point of view, I compare epilot to Stripe, as soon as they fully support all kinds of online payments for commodity products on top of their platform. Stripe was valued at $20M back in 2011, since then they exploded into $95.6 billion!

epilot's numbers are very different, but the potential is similar, and maybe even bigger.

### Why Under a Rock?

Because COVID was really the trigger for them and for many companies to open their hiring reach to other countries without forcing a relocation. When the need to hire more talent came and remoting was finally an option, then suddenly epilot became exposed to people that would never lay their fingers on their codebase, if remote was not allowed.

Remote does pose a challenge, to team dynamics and the modus operandi of a company, but when talent is something so hard to find these days and quality really matters, especially for a startup where the core nucleus needs cohesiveness and consistency, I would say the costs more than compensate the risks.

On a final note, also to add to the rock factor, their website does not yet fully expose or reflect how great the product they are building is and how their Engineering and Products teams work. So, too focused on the customer and the rest still needs a bit more iterations. But hey! They are still 4 years old, they have amazing teams from Exec, to Sales, IT, HR, Customer Success, Engineering and Product. Plus every single person I have met, from every single one of these departments, is an inspiration and truly believes in what epilot is doing.

How many companies have you seen like that? Not many.

Also, they take care of their people, both professionally and financially. Thus, the "Diamond Gem under a Rock" status!

## The German Energy Market

The graph above shows the German Combined Enterprise value just for the Energy sector. And as you can see it's a €100 billion market with high growth in the number of startups and scale-ups from the Future Unicorn level to the Decacorn level. Place in which epilot is quite well positioned for the Unicorn status. Quite exciting!

## Fun Facts About Germany

So, to resume, I had a great business trip to Cologne. Germany seems indeed a great place both to live and work and just for the sake of sharing, did you know that:

- One-third of Germany is still covered in forests and woodlands. The greener the better for me, a house in the middle of a forest would be a great place for my family and me.
- Germany is a member of the European Union. No VISA issues for Europeans.
- 65% of the highways in Germany (Autobahn) have no speed limit. And so, if you are a BMW fan like I am, you can get to ride your BMW M4 with the pedal to the metal, full torque!
- University is free for everyone (even non-Germans) and Germany has one of the best education systems worldwide. Great for anyone with kids.
- There are over 2100 castles in Germany. I always said I was going to own my own Castle! With 3 princesses at home, I'm totally starting to need one!
