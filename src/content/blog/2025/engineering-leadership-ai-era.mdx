## Thoughts

The engineering leadership of tomorrow won't look like today's. We're moving from a world where we told computers what to do, to one where we collaborate with intelligent systems. The engineers who thrive will be those who embrace this change, who see AI as a partner rather than a threat, and who focus on the uniquely human aspects of problem-solving.

The title "Distinguished Engineer" will mean something different in five years. It won't be about mastery of current tools, but about the ability to navigate constant change, to make decisions under uncertainty, and to lead teams through transformation.
