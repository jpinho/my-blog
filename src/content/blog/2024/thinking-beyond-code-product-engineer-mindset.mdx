In this episode of the Product Engineer Podcast, Josh and I explore the fundamental shift from being just a coder to thinking like a real product builder. We discuss how engineers can move beyond only delivering features and start focusing on creating real value for customers and achieving business outcomes.

## The Evolution from Coder to Product Engineer

The traditional path for many engineers starts with writing code that works. But as you grow, you realize that working code is just the beginning. The real question becomes: does this code solve a real problem for real people?

## Key Topics We Cover

### Understanding the Product Engineer Mindset
- Moving from "how" to "why" and "what if"
- The difference between feature delivery and value creation
- Why business context matters more than perfect code
- Building with empathy for end users

### The Three Pillars of Product Engineering

#### 1. Customer Obsession
- Understanding user problems before writing solutions
- Speaking directly with customers when possible
- Thinking in user journeys, not just features
- Measuring success by customer outcomes, not lines of code

#### 2. Business Acumen
- Understanding how your code impacts revenue
- Knowing the cost implications of technical decisions
- Balancing engineering excellence with time-to-market
- Speaking the language of stakeholders

#### 3. Systems Thinking
- Seeing beyond individual components
- Understanding downstream effects of changes
- Considering operational implications from day one
- Building for scale while shipping incrementally

## Real-World Examples from epilot

### The Pricing Engine Story
We share how building epilot's pricing engine taught us that the most elegant technical solution isn't always the right product solution. The journey from a technically perfect but rigid system to a flexible, business-friendly solution that actually serves customer needs.

### When Over-Engineering Hurts
A candid discussion about times when our pursuit of technical excellence actually slowed down business value delivery, and how we learned to find the right balance.

## The Mindset Shifts

### From Individual Contributor to Product Thinker
1. **Before**: "I completed my ticket"
2. **After**: "I solved the customer's problem"

### From Technical Metrics to Business Metrics
1. **Before**: "The API responds in 50ms"
2. **After**: "Users complete checkout 30% faster"

### From Isolation to Collaboration
1. **Before**: "I'll implement what the PM specified"
2. **After**: "Let's discuss if this is the right solution"

## Practical Advice for Engineers

### How to Start Thinking Like a Product Engineer

1. **Ask "Why" More Often**
   - Why are we building this feature?
   - Why does the customer need this?
   - Why now and not later?

2. **Get Closer to Customers**
   - Join customer calls when possible
   - Read support tickets regularly
   - Use your own product critically

3. **Learn the Business**
   - Understand your company's business model
   - Know your key metrics and KPIs
   - Follow industry trends and competitors

4. **Think in Experiments**
   - Propose MVPs instead of perfect solutions
   - Measure and iterate based on data
   - Be comfortable with "good enough" when appropriate

### Building Product Intuition

- Shadow product managers to understand their thinking
- Participate in product discovery sessions
- Read books on product management and business strategy
- Practice writing PRDs (Product Requirement Documents)

## The Impact on Career Growth

We discuss how adopting a product engineer mindset has accelerated our careers:
- Faster progression to senior roles
- More influence on product direction
- Better relationships with stakeholders
- Increased job satisfaction from seeing real impact

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Analysis Paralysis**: Trying to understand everything before shipping anything
2. **Ignoring Technical Debt**: Swinging too far toward shipping at any cost
3. **Losing Engineering Excellence**: Forgetting that quality still matters
4. **Becoming a Mini-PM**: You're still an engineer, just with broader perspective

## The Cultural Shift at epilot

How we're building a culture of product engineers:
- Engineers participate in customer discovery
- Technical decisions are discussed in business terms
- Success is measured by customer outcomes
- Cross-functional collaboration is the default

## Questions from the Discussion

### "How do I convince my team to adopt this mindset?"
Start with yourself. Show the value through your own work. Share customer feedback, connect technical work to business outcomes, and gradually influence the culture around you.

### "What if my company doesn't support this approach?"
Even in feature factory environments, you can practice product thinking. Ask questions, understand context, and communicate your work's impact in business terms.

### "How technical should I stay?"
Very technical! Product thinking doesn't replace engineering excellence—it enhances it by ensuring you're solving the right problems with the right solutions.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Product engineering is not about becoming less technical**—it's about adding business and customer context to your technical skills
2. **Start small**: You don't need permission to start thinking about user impact
3. **Measure differently**: Success isn't just about code quality but customer outcomes
4. **Stay curious**: The best product engineers never stop asking "why"
5. **Balance is key**: Not every decision needs to be perfect, but every decision should be intentional
