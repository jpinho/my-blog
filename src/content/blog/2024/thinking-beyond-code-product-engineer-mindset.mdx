## The Evolution from Coder to Product Engineer

The traditional path for many engineers starts with writing code that works. But as you grow, you realize that working code is just the beginning. The real question becomes: does this code solve a real problem for real people?

## Key Topics We Cover

### Understanding the Product Engineer Mindset
- Moving from "how" to "why" and "what if"
- The difference between feature delivery and value creation
- Why business context matters more than perfect code
- Building with empathy for end users

### The Three Pillars of Product Engineering

#### 1. Customer Obsession
- Understanding user problems before writing solutions
- Speaking directly with customers when possible
- Thinking in user journeys, not just features
- Measuring success by customer outcomes, not lines of code

#### 2. Business Acumen
- Understanding how your code impacts revenue
- Knowing the cost implications of technical decisions
- Balancing engineering excellence with time-to-market
- Speaking the language of stakeholders

#### 3. Systems Thinking
- Seeing beyond individual components
- Understanding downstream effects of changes
- Considering operational implications from day one
- Building for scale while shipping incrementally
