## Key Topics Covered

### The Reality of Enterprise AI
- Why sophisticated AI tools often fail in traditional industries
- The importance of matching solutions to actual user workflows
- Building for adoption, not just technical impressiveness

### Practical Lessons from epilot
- How we integrated AI into our XRM platform
- Challenges with pricing system automation
- The balance between innovation and reliability

### Technical Architecture
- Designing AI systems that scale
- Managing costs and ROI in production
- The importance of fallback mechanisms

### Team Dynamics
- Leading AI initiatives across engineering teams
- Bridging the gap between data scientists and product engineers
- Creating a culture of pragmatic innovation

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with the problem, not the technology** - The most advanced AI model is useless if it doesn't solve real user problems.

2. **Design for failure** - AI systems fail differently than traditional software. Build resilience from day one.

3. **Measure actual impact** - Track adoption, not just accuracy. Monitor ROI, not just performance metrics.

4. **Iterate based on reality** - User feedback beats theoretical improvements every time.
