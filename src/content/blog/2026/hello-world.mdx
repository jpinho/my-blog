This is the first post on my new blog. Built with Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS v4, and MDX for content.

## Why Next.js?

I wanted a React-based setup with full control over the rendering pipeline. Next.js gives me static generation for blog posts, API routes for search, and the flexibility to add dynamic features later without rewriting everything.

## The Stack

Here's what powers this site:

- **Next.js 15** with App Router and static generation
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling with dark mode support
- **MDX** for content with code highlighting
- **Vercel** for deployment with automatic deploys from GitHub

## Code Highlighting

Here's a quick TypeScript example:

```typescript
interface Post {
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  date: string;
  tags: string[];
}

function getLatestPosts(posts: Post[], limit: number): Post[] {
  return posts
    .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.date).getTime() - new Date(a.date).getTime())
    .slice(0, limit);
}
```

And some Rust because why not:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn word_count(text: &str) -> HashMap<&str, usize> {
    let mut counts = HashMap::new();
    for word in text.split_whitespace() {
        *counts.entry(word).or_insert(0) += 1;
    }
    counts
}
```
