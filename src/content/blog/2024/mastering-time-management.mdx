How do you fit 10 hours of weekly training, a 40–50 hour workweek, and family time into a 24-hour day? Discipline is my framework — and it can be yours too.

> "Discipline equals freedom" — Jocko Willink.

This is a post about some of my learnings during my quest to master the art of "Time Management". And it starts with a story of how it developed for me.

## Why Time Management Matters

On average I workout around 10h per week (Triathlon training & Jiu Jitsu), while being available to work 40–50h per week. I also have a family and 2 kids (common for a 36yr old), so allocating time for all of this requires some discipline.

After a couple of years at it, I learned a couple of things with sports, that turned out to be invaluable for my personal and professional success:

- Anything I really need to do, outside the work schedule that requires focus, needs to be done from 5AM to 7:30AM (after that it's kids time to school) — that gives me 2.5h every day
- During workouts, I listen to audiobooks — except during intense Zone 4–5 sessions, where even thinking feels impossible. Thankfully I really enjoy endurance, over long runs
- Ensuring predictable energy levels and a consistent routine requires consistent sleep schedules, without exceptions

The constant goal of 8 to 10h a week of sports, works as a constant pressure to make everything else fall in place:

- Kids time to rise and sleep
- Time to eat
- Time to workout
- Time to study
- No alcohol or smoke as it compromises execution

## My Framework for Success

This routine is super important, because it is the base of my programming, it works like a framework. And on top of this framework I can do anything I set my mind to.

Example: I'm so disciplined to workout 10h a week, that what I created was a habit, or a set of micro habits. And I can decide when to use it for whatever I want:

- Deliver a given feature before deadline to gain customer X or make it to the next release
- Build a side project for Y
- Learn about managing up or how to become a better Principal Engineer
- Learn about finance and economics
- Write a blog post
- Record a podcast
- Learn how to prototype in Figma

## Practical Tips

Within the time I'm used to allocate for sports, I can give myself time to pursue goals throughout the year. The key is finding the right pace or balance. Some weeks, I'll shift 1–2 hours from workouts to non-sports goals, knowing I'll make it up later.

Every week my Strava metrics show me the count of hours at sports. And it's funny to see that every Sunday at 23:59 the count goes back to zero! Every Monday, I restart with the same grit and energy — ready to create new memories, hit my goals, and keep moving forward.

## Lessons Learned

Through discipline, I mastered the art of "Making time" for what matters most. Key takeaways to help you master time management:

- Prioritize early mornings for high-focus tasks
- Combine activities like workouts and learning through audiobooks
- Maintain consistent energy with regular sleep — this boosts both mood and confidence

## Achievement Highlight

This routine has helped me achieve personal and professional goals, including completing a 70.3 Ironman in 5h37min and excelling as a Principal Engineer — all while being present for my family.
