In this fireside chat at the Engineering Leadership Summit, I discuss the fundamental shifts happening in engineering leadership as AI transforms how we build software.

## The Evolution of Engineering Leadership

### From Code to Strategy
Five years ago, being a great engineer meant writing elegant code. Today, at the Distinguished Engineer level, it's about:
- Understanding which problems are worth solving
- Orchestrating AI and human intelligence effectively
- Making strategic decisions that impact entire organizations
- Building systems that scale both technically and organizationally

### The Paradox of AI Enhancement
"AI makes us better engineers, but it also raises the bar for what 'better' means."

We discuss how AI is simultaneously:
- Lowering the barrier to entry for basic coding
- Raising expectations for what engineers should deliver
- Creating new categories of engineering work
- Changing the fundamental nature of technical leadership

## Key Discussion Points

### The Death of the 10x Engineer Myth
Why the concept of individual productivity multipliers is becoming obsolete:
- AI is the ultimate leveler for raw coding speed
- Value creation is shifting from volume to judgment
- System thinking beats individual brilliance
- The best engineers are now force multipliers for teams

### Product Engineering: The New Reality
The convergence we're seeing:
1. **Engineers becoming product thinkers** - Understanding business context is no longer optional
2. **Product managers becoming technical** - AI enables non-engineers to prototype
3. **The rise of the hybrid role** - Product Engineers who span both domains

### Cognitive Load and Decision Fatigue
A critical challenge for modern engineering leaders:
- Managing information overload in AI-augmented environments
- The exhaustion of constant context switching
- Why "deep work" is both more important and harder to achieve
- Strategies for maintaining focus in a world of infinite possibilities

## Practical Leadership Insights

### Leading AI Initiatives at epilot
Real experiences from the trenches:
- How we introduced AI without creating fear
- Building trust in AI-generated code
- The importance of gradual adoption
- Measuring success beyond traditional metrics

### The Three Phases of AI Adoption
1. **Experimentation Phase** - "Look what AI can do!"
2. **Disillusionment Phase** - "This is harder than we thought"
3. **Integration Phase** - "AI is just another tool in our toolkit"

### Building Teams for the AI Era
What I look for when hiring now:
- **Curiosity over expertise** - Technologies change too fast
- **Systems thinking** - Understanding how parts connect
- **Communication skills** - More critical than ever
- **Judgment** - Knowing when to use AI and when not to

## The Distinguished Engineer Perspective

### What Distinguished Means Today
It's not about:
- Being the best coder
- Knowing the most frameworks
- Having all the answers

It's about:
- Making decisions with incomplete information
- Bridging technical and business domains
- Multiplying team effectiveness
- Building sustainable systems

### The Loneliness of Technical Leadership
An honest discussion about:
- The isolation that comes with seniority
- Imposter syndrome in the age of AI
- The pressure of strategic decisions
- Finding peer support and mentorship

## Controversial Takes

### "Most Engineers Are Building the Wrong Things"
Why I believe 70% of what we build doesn't matter:
- Feature factories vs. value creation
- The addiction to technical complexity
- How to identify what actually moves the needle
- The courage to say "no" to interesting problems

### "AI Won't Replace Engineers, But..."
The nuanced reality:
- Junior roles are genuinely at risk
- Mid-level engineers face the biggest disruption
- Senior roles are transforming, not disappearing
- New opportunities we haven't imagined yet

## Audience Q&A Highlights

### "How do you stay relevant?"
My approach:
- Spend 20% of time learning, always
- Build real things, don't just read about them
- Teach others - it forces clarity
- Embrace being a beginner regularly

### "What's your biggest mistake as a leader?"
Believing that technical excellence alone was enough. The best solution that doesn't get adopted is worse than a good-enough solution that does.

### "Where is engineering heading?"
Towards a world where:
- Writing code is commodity
- Understanding problems is premium
- AI handles implementation
- Humans handle intention

## The Human Element

### Triathlon as Leadership Training
Why endurance sports matter for engineering:
- Learning to suffer productively
- The importance of consistent training
- Managing energy over time
- Accepting that some days are just hard

### Family and Balance
Being a father while being a Distinguished Engineer:
- Why perfect balance is a myth
- The seasons of intensity
- Teaching kids about technology
- Modeling continuous learning

## Final Thoughts

The engineering leadership of tomorrow won't look like today's. We're moving from a world where we told computers what to do, to one where we collaborate with intelligent systems. The engineers who thrive will be those who embrace this change, who see AI as a partner rather than a threat, and who focus on the uniquely human aspects of problem-solving.

The title "Distinguished Engineer" will mean something different in five years. It won't be about mastery of current tools, but about the ability to navigate constant change, to make decisions under uncertainty, and to lead teams through transformation.

## About This Discussion

This fireside chat took place at the Engineering Leadership Summit 2025 in Berlin, bringing together technical leaders from across Europe to discuss the future of our profession. The conversation was moderated by Sarah Chen, VP of Engineering at TechCrunch.
